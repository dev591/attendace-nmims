# Antigravity Attendance: The Future of Campus Engagement

## 1. The Problem
- **Archaic Systems**: Paper sheets, clunky ERPs, and manual entry lead to errors and proxy attendance.
- **Student Anxiety**: "How many classes can I miss?" requires manual calculation, leading to stress or accidental debarment.
- **Admin Blindspots**: Departments lack real-time visibility into attendance trends until it's too late to intervene.

## 2. The Solution: Antigravity Attendance
A **mobile-first, intelligent attendance platform** that empowers students and simplifies administration.
- **Visual & Intuitive**: Glassmorphism UI that feels like a modern consumer app, not enterprise drudgery.
- **Proactive Intelligence**: "What-if" simulators and risk alerts prevent detention before it happens.
- **Seamless Verification**: QR codes, Geofencing, and simple correction workflows.

## 3. Key Features
| Student | Faculty | Admin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Live Dashboard**: Real-time % bubbles | **Instant Mark**: QR / One-tap list | **Macro Analytics**: Dept heatmaps |
| **Bunk Calculator**: "Can I miss tomorrow?" | **Smart Flags**: See who is at risk | **Audit Trail**: Full change logs |
| **Correction Flow**: Upload proof easily | **Bulk Actions**: CSV Uploads | **Configurable Rules**: Custom thresholds |

## 4. Why "Antigravity"?
- **Zero Friction**: We remove the "weight" of administrative bureaucracy.
- **Floating UI**: Our design mimics weightlessness—fluid, fast, and delightful.
- **Uplifting**: Helps keep student attendance *up* through positive reinforcement.

## 5. Pilot Plan (3 Months)
- **Month 1: Setup**: Import data for 1 Department (CS). Onboard 500 students.
- **Month 2: Live Trial**: Run parallel with manual system. Test QR & Geo-fencing.
- **Month 3: Review**: Analyze actionable insights (typically 15% reduction in chronic absenteeism).
